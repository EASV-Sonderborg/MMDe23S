                    <p class="projectInfo__description">Destination Sønderjylland (DSSJ) is an organization founded in 2015 by the municipalities of Haderslev, Aabenraa, Tønder, and Sønderborg. It operates four major websites offering information about trails, events, attractions, and activities in the region, as well as options to book experiences. Its goal is to attract and inspire tourists to visit Southern Jutland and strengthen the local economy by increasing tourism revenue. DSSJ focuses on four main themes: Nature, History, Culinary Experiences, and Active Together.</p>

                    <h3 class="projectInfo__heading">The problem</h3>
                    <p class="projectInfo__description">The current website, visitsonderjylland.dk, mainly targets adult couples and visitors aged 50+. It works well for trip research but offers little for families or on-site activity planning. With the upcoming opening of Nordborg Resort in 2025, more families are expected to visit the area. To reach this audience, Destination Sønderjylland aims to enhance the Sønderborg site with improved guest services for families.</p>

                    <h3 class="projectInfo__heading">The action</h3>
                    <p class="projectInfo__description">In the design process, we focused on creating a more interactive and family-friendly experience for the Sønderborg website. We added sliders and an interactive hero section to make the site feel dynamic and engaging, while a playful map on the kids’ page encourages exploration through visuals. To support families, we implemented filters that allow users to sort activities by age or accessibility and added badges showing suitability for children or pets. High-quality imagery and clear activity previews were used to inspire bookings, and a visible newsletter sign-up plus social media links strengthened the connection between visitors and the organization.</p>
